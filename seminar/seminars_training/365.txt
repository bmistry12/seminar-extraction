<paragraph><sentence> Title: 	MULTIPLE-MODEL MACHINE VISION</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Images are fundamentally inhomogeneous, yet most machine vision work has
been based on homogeneous processing using a single type of image model.</sentence><sentence>We
have developed a framework for inhomogeneous, multiple-model machine vision
using a Minimum Description Length (MDL)/Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
selection criterion.</sentence><sentence>I will talk about how we have applied this framework
to the problem of multiple-object structure/egomotion from uncalibrated
video, and the problem of object recognition using 2-D aspect models.</sentence></paragraph>
