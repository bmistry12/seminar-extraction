<paragraph><sentence> TITLE:	Learning Control for Improved Performance in 
 	Repetitive Robot Operations</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Learning control refers to control systems that can learn from previous 
experience performing a specific task, in order to improve their performance 
in future executions of the task.</sentence><sentence>Although there are some precursors, the filed 
started in 1984 with several researchers on different continents (including 
Professor Longman, then Australia) addressing the problem of improving control 
system performance for robots performing repetitive tasks on assembly lines.</sentence><sentence>The talk will give an overview of learning control strategies that make use of 
control theory concepts to accomplish their learning.</sentence></paragraph>
