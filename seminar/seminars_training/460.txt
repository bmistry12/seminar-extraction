<paragraph><sentence>	Logical Interpretations and Computational Simulations
			   Tim Griffin
      		      AT&T Bell Laboratories</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>	There are many examples in the literature of mathematical 
	logic concerning the interpretation of one logical system 
	in another.</sentence><sentence>From a perspective informed by the 
	formulae-as-types correspondence, it is natural to 
	investigate logical interpretations from a computational 
	point of view.</sentence><sentence>Of particular interest are logical 
	interpretations that can be associated with simulations 
	of one computational system in another.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>	The talk surveys several results of this kind, including 
	interpretations of classical logic in constructive logic 
	that can be associated with ``continuation passing style'' 
	transformations.</sentence><sentence>These transformations simulate a functional 
	language extended with control operators in a purely 
	functional language.</sentence></paragraph>
