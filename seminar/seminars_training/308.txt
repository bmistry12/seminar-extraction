    Multiple types   of  knowledge (syntax,  semantics,   pragmatics, etc.)</sentence><sentence>contribute to establishing the meaning of  an  utterance.</sentence><sentence>Delaying the use
of   a knowledge   source    during   language   comprehension   introduces
computational inefficiency in the  form  of overgeneration.</sentence><sentence>On the  other
hand, ensuring that all relevant knowledge is brought  to bear as each word
in the sentence is understood is a difficult design problem.</sentence><sentence>As a solution
to this problem, we present  NL-Soar, a language comprehension system  that
integrates  disparate knowledge sources automatically.</sentence><sentence>Through experience,
the nature of the understanding process changes from deliberate, sequential
problem   solving to  recognitional  comprehension   that  applies all  the
relevant knowledge sources    simultaneously to  each word.</sentence><sentence>The dynamic
character of the system results directly from its implementation within the
Soar architecture.</sentence></paragraph>
