<paragraph><sentence> Title:		Neural net models of lightness and color constancy.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>	One of the key problems in vision is segmentation of images into 
	labeled patches that represent features, surfaces and objects in the
	scene.</sentence><sentence>Analytical models for delineating and labeling surfaces as
	white, black, grey or color regardless of variation in intensity or
	hue of the illuminant remain a matter of controversy.</sentence><sentence>Computational
	neuroscience allows test of the compatibility between physiological
	data and computational theories of lightness and color constancy.</sentence><sentence>We
	present here a quantitative investigation of luminance and color 
	contrast processing using computer based models of neural networks 
	derived from the anatomy and physiology of these visual functions.</sentence></paragraph>
