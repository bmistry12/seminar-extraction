<paragraph><sentence>In the last five years or so, many economists and associated pundits
have born much bad news about the effect of computers on productivity.</sentence><sentence>I'll show you the data, and conclude that things probably are just as
bad as they seem.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Then we'll look for root causes and possible cures.</sentence><sentence>The main problem is that
computer applications are of little help for improving the efficiency of the
routine mental work of the information economy, and have been improving too
slowly.</sentence><sentence>The good news is that simple, cheap, empirical usability
evaluation and redesign can turn the situation around.</sentence><sentence>Fairly compelling
evidence will be displayed.</sentence></paragraph>
