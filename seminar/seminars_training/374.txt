<paragraph><sentence> TOPIC:    Iterative Design of Efficient Parallel Programs</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> DATE:     Friday, September 18, 1992</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> TIME:     <stime>2:30</stime> pm</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> PLACE:    Wean Hall 4605</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This talk describes an environment to derive efficient parallel
implementations from program specifications using stepwise 
refinement.</sentence><sentence>The environment is built around a data parallel
notation called UC.</sentence><sentence>Novel aspects of UC include:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>* support for the design of rapid prototypes 
* incremental refinements for efficiency via dynamic data 
  distributions and progressively weaker synchronizations
* portability across synchronous and asynchronous architectures
* simple control-flow constructs to ensure that correctness 
  proofs are no more complicated than for equivalent 
  sequential programs.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>A UC compiler is available for the CM-2; a sequential emulator 
for UC is also available and a multicomputer implementation 
is in progress.</sentence><sentence>Measurements of the UC compiler on selected 
numerical and graph applications will be presented.</sentence></paragraph>
