       	   On The Mathematics of Non-monotonic Reasoning

<paragraph><sentence>Non-monotonic reasoning is an attempt to develop reasoning systems
where an inference means that the conclusion holds in the "normal case",
in "most cases", but it does not necessarily hold in all cases.</sentence><sentence>It seems 
that this type of reasoning is needed if one wants to model everyday
common-sense reasoning.</sentence><sentence>There have been many models suggested for
non-monotonic reasoning (like circumscription, default logic, autoepistemic 
logic, etc).</sentence><sentence>We study all these approaches in a more abstract fashion by 
considering the inference relation of the reasoning system, and clarify 
the role of different inference rules and the impact they have on the 
model theory of the logic.</sentence><sentence>We are especially interested in a particular 
rule called "Rational Monotony" and the connection between it and 
probabilistic models.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> NOTE: Prof. Magidor will also give a Math Department Colloquium on Friday
 February 7.</sentence></paragraph>
