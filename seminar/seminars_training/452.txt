 	in Higher Education</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> ABSTRACT: Not since the introduction of chalkboards in the 1800s has
 the classroom been so challenged in regard to its basic design and
 pedagogical setting.</sentence><sentence>Neither overhead transparencies nor TV monitors
 provide the kind of dynamic, interactive capabilities seen on today's
 high resolution monitors.</sentence><sentence>Indeed, it is precisely the evolutionary
 symbiosis of powerful computers and good software that today provides
 the first real challenge to the traditional classroom setting.</sentence><sentence>The
 presentation will discuss all aspects of educational computing as it
is currently evolving: its history and context, issues of
instructional design and evaluation, technical support and
administrative advocacy, and the "computational turn" that is
affecting every academic discipline.</sentence><sentence>Concrete examples from Dr.
Cavalier's classes at Carnegie Mellon will conclude the presentation.</sentence><sentence>These examples include the use of interactive multimedia, a hypertext
syllabus to display and disseminate classroom materials, a
class-specific electronic bulletin board, and the potential
utilization of "Tele-profs" via network-based video mail.</sentence></paragraph>
