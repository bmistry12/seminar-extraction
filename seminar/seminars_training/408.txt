<paragraph><sentence> 		       Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
                          Mellon Institute Bldg.</sentence><sentence>Third Floor Conference Room             
				Oct 11, <stime>4:00</stime> p.m.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>(If you don't know where this room is, meet at 3:45 p.m. at the 5th floor 
entrance and we can walk over together.)</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>          The TERA Computer System is a scalable shared memory MIMD computer.</sentence><sentence>Although it has no vector instructions, the 256 processor version
	  will have peak performance of about 300 GFLOPS.</sentence><sentence>The arithmetic
	  will conform to IEEE standard 754.</sentence><sentence>The system's I/O cache, used 
	  with disk arrays, will enable file system bandwidths of 70
	  gigabytes per second or more.</sentence><sentence>The languages available will be
	  Fortran 77, C and C++, and the programming environment will support
	  a mixture of explicit programmer-generated and aggressive compiler-
	  generated parallelism.</sentence><sentence>Tools will be provided to help users 
	  re-engineer programs for parallel execution and to debug optimized,
	  parallelized code.</sentence><sentence>A 16-processor system will be available for
	  customer benchmarking in first quarter 1991.</sentence><sentence>First system 
	  deliveries are scheduled for fourth quarter 1993.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>	  The talk will describe the overall architecture of the system and
	  its hardware implementation; the programming environment and
	  associated tools; the operating system, including the file system;
	  and the company's status and long-range plans.</sentence></paragraph>
