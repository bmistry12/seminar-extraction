<paragraph><sentence> TITLE: FILTERS FOR IMAGE RESAMPLING</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>A common problem in image processing is resampling a raster image.</sentence><sentence>This task crops up when removing distortions from satellite images and
when performing texture mapping in computer graphics, for example.</sentence><sentence>Careful filtering must be done during resampling or the results will
appear blocky or show aliasing.</sentence><sentence>Traditionally, most research in
resampling has addressed special cases.</sentence><sentence>Often, the class of mappings
is restricted to be affine (translation, rotation, and scaling), in
which case the filter is space invariant.</sentence><sentence>Furthermore, filters are
often designed for interpolation (upsampling) only or decimation
(downsampling) only.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In this talk, we develop a unified theory for image resampling filters,
which subsumes previous methods for affine mappings, interpolation, and
decimation.</sentence><sentence>The theory describes the space variant filter for
resampling a multidimensional signal according to an arbitrary mapping
without aliasing.</sentence><sentence>A simple, fast approximation technique employing
elliptical Gaussian filters will be demonstrated.</sentence></paragraph>
