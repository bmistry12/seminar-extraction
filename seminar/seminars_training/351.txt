<paragraph><sentence> TITLE:		Antarctic Exploration Robotics</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>CMU's DANTE robot will soon explore an active volcano in Antarctica.</sentence><sentence>DANTE is a remote geologist and a harbinger of polar and planetary robots.</sentence><sentence>The exploration objective of the project is to study the gas from the lava 
lake.</sentence><sentence>The robotics objectives of this program are to navigate the extreme 
terrain of the crater walls, and to operate in harsh conditions.</sentence><sentence>The 
technical challenges include perception, locomotion and mission 
performance in planet-like conditions.</sentence><sentence>The system envisioned for 
this exploration includes a novel walking robot, camera and scanner 
vision, scientific sampling devices, remote interfaces and a satellite 
data link for live feedback to the US.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This seminar profiles the technical challenges with progress and 
approaches that address them.</sentence><sentence>Examples include a new laser range 
scanner for terrain modeling, non-contact foot sensing and mechanics 
for combining the tension of a climbing rope with the motions of a 
walking robot.</sentence><sentence>A lab visit following the presentation provides the 
opportunity to view results to date.</sentence></paragraph>
