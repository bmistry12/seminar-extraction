<paragraph><sentence>Vectorization techniques have proved to be extremely effective
for large-scale reservoir simulations.</sentence><sentence>Parallel capabilities
hold even greater potential for these enormous problems.</sentence><sentence>Domain
decomposition methods can allow the physical problem to be divided
up into many similar problems that can be addressed separately,
in parallel, on different processors.</sentence><sentence>These techniques also allow
efficient application of local grid refinement to resolve the
important local phenomena that may govern the flow process.</sentence><sentence>Eulerian-Lagrangian methods that follow the flow also can profit
extensively from parallel treatment of the characteristics of the
flow.</sentence><sentence>The effectiveness of these techniques will be demonstrated
on research codes and illustrative applications.</sentence></paragraph>
