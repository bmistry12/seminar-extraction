Student Center Room 207(CMU)
ABSTRACT: In my talk, I will describe how a cognitive model was used
 as a simulated student to help design instructions for training
 circuit board assemblers. The model was built in the Soar cognitive
 architecture, and was initially endowed with only minimal prerequisite
 knowledge of the task, and an ability to learn instructions.  Lessons
 for teaching expert assembly skills were developed by iteratively
 drafting and testing instructions on the simulated student
