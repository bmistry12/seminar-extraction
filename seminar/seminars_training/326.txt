<paragraph><sentence>Running and juggling are examples of intermittent dynamic tasks.</sentence><sentence>That
is, they require a manipulator alternately to be in contact with and
out of contact with another object, and the relative velocity at
contact is large.</sentence><sentence>During the noncontact, or "ballistic" phase, the
manipulator loses the ability to control some of the degrees of freedom
of the overall system.</sentence><sentence>The ballistic phase ends with an impact as
contact is re-established.</sentence><sentence>The general control strategy for a
manipulator faced with such a task is two-fold.</sentence><sentence>During the contact
phase, the manipulator must establish appropriate initial conditions
for the ballistic phase.</sentence><sentence>During the ballistic phase, it must prepare
for the inevitable impact.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>How well do established control laws for running and juggling fit with
this idea of alternately establishing initial conditions and preparing
for impact?</sentence><sentence>I'll discuss Marc Raibert's control law for running that
decomposes the problem along the degrees of freedom of the mechanism,
and Martin Buhler's use of a "mirror" algorithm for juggling.</sentence></paragraph>
