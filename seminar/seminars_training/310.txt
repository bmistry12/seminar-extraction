<paragraph><sentence> WHEN:     Friday, February 3, 1995; <stime>3:30 pm</stime> - <etime>5:00 pm</etime>
          Refreshments will be served starting at 3:15 pm.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> WHERE:    ADAMSON WING Auditorium in Baker Hall</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> SPEAKER:  Mel Siegel
 	  Senior Research Scientist
           Robotics Institute</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> TITLE:	  3D-TV (and Workstations)</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>High definition, high speed displays integrated with fast digitization,
image storage, and image processing now permit us to implement several
concepts for 3D-sterescopic television (and computer workstations), many
of which have been around, unimplementable, for a long time.</sentence><sentence>In this
talk I will:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>  -- review the fundamentals of binocular 3D-stereoscopic vision</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>  -- review historical approaches to 3D-image and 3D-stream pair display</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>  -- narrow the discussion to approaches that use a single more-or-less flat
     screen (like a TV or workstation monitor)</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>  -- describe my group's research in several areas:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>     ** the physics of re-creating naked-eye and augmented-eye reality</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>     ** the state-of-the-art in video: delivering the full spatial and
        temporal resolution of an NTSC stream per eye</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>     ** three increasingly sophisticated approaches to presenting video
        and/or computer graphics on a workstation</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>        ~~ a well known special purpose hardware based full-screen,
           half spatial resolution approach</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>        ~~ our adaptation of this approach to an X-Windows environment,
           still full screen</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>        ~~ our new "Stereo-in-Windows" approach, which allows arbitrary
           mixes of stereo and flat XWindows on one screen at one time
           at full resolution</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>     ** progress in the (I will show you: related) areas of image compression,
        intermediate view interpolation, and user-adjustable stereopsis</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>  -- demonstrate as much of this as it is practical to set up in the Adamson
     Wing auditorium [TBD].</sentence></paragraph>
