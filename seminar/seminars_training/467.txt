<paragraph><sentence> Topic:     Algorithms for Square Roots of Graphs</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The {\em kth power} of a graph  G = (V, E), written G^k,
is defined to be the graph having V as its vertex set with
vertices u, v adjacent in G^k if and only if
there exists a path of length at most k between them.</sentence><sentence>Similarly, graph H has a {\em kth root} G if G^k = H.
Powers of graphs have several interesting properties.</sentence><sentence>For example, the square of any biconnected graph and the
cube of any connected graph is hamiltonian.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In this talk, we present algorithms to find a square
root G of a graph G^2 for the following special classes of graphs:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>	Find G given G^2, where G is a tree, in O(m) time.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>	Find G given G^2, where G^2 is planar, in O(n) time.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>	Find G given G^2, where G is a subdivided graph, in O(m n) time.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Finding square roots of subdivided graphs is equivalent to inverting
total graphs.</sentence><sentence>In addition, we present several results on the complexity
of finding maximum cliques and hamiltonian cycles in powers of graphs.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This is joint work with Yaw-Ling Lin.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> Host: Dana Scott</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Steve Skiena will be at CMU Monday, January 13, and Tuesday, February 14.</sentence></paragraph>
