<paragraph><sentence> TITLE:  Using Two-Dimensional Image Matching to Interpret the Three-Dimensional World</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>We are investigating the extent to which two-dimensional representations
are applicable to tasks that involve interacting with the three-dimensional
world.</sentence><sentence>We have been using two-dimensional geometry extracted from images to
solve a number of problems, including tracking moving objects, segmenting
images based on motion, and navigating a mobile robot to a target.</sentence><sentence>Our
methods are based on comparing portions of one image with another, under
various transformations, using the generalized Hausdorff measure.</sentence><sentence>This
measure determines the resemblance of point sets (binary images) by
examining the fraction of points in one set that are near points in the
other (and perhaps vice versa).</sentence><sentence>Unlike most measures used in model-based
matching, this measure is not based on computing a correspondence between
points in the two sets.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In this talk, I will describe the generalized Hausdorff measure, discuss how
to compute it efficiently, and then present applications of the measure to
motion tracking and visually guided navigation problems.</sentence></paragraph>
