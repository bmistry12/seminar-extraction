<paragraph><sentence>Over the past few years, the thrust of research in planning has moved
away from the notion of a plan as a proof and more towards an approach
that integrates planning and execution.</sentence><sentence>Rather than building systems that
produce plans, researchers are more concerned with systems that
produce behavior in the face of a changing world.</sentence><sentence>This change in
focus opens up a wide variety of new problems that ``planners'' have
to deal with.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In this talk, I will discuss one view of these issues and outline an
approach for dealing with them that combines what has been labeled
``case-based planning'' with a reactive componant and a learning
mechanism that uses run-time expectation failures to focus the
planner's attention on gaps in its knowledge base.</sentence><sentence>In terms of
planning, the system is able to recover from many execution-time
failures as well as capitalize on unforseen opportunities.</sentence><sentence>In terms
of learning, it is able to learn from both run-time opportunities and
unexpected execution problems.</sentence></paragraph>
