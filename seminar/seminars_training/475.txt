   It  has been five years since I stopped working on Andrew, so the freedom
   of information act -- along with the passing from power of several people
   --  allows  me  to  tell  some  candid stories about it.</sentence><sentence>In 1983, the ITC
   started and grew to about 30 people.</sentence><sentence>Eight were IBMers, ten  or  so  were
   newly  minted  Ph.D.s  from  our  very  own  department.</sentence><sentence>We built Andrew,
   partially in the model of Spice and the Alto  system.</sentence><sentence>It  achieved  some
   real  successes  but  didn't accomplish all that we'd hoped.</sentence><sentence>Much of the
   problem was intrinsic to the way the world is, compared to how we thought
   it   was.</sentence><sentence>I   often  meet  people  who  still  have  some  of  my  1982
   misperceptions.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>   I will reconsider some of the early,  crucial  decisions  of  the  Andrew
   project  related  to  wiring,  protocols, workstations, file systems, and
   software.</sentence><sentence>I'll assess the impact of Andrew on education and discuss  what
   IBM  and  CMU  ultimately  got  out  of  it.</sentence><sentence>I will argue that UNIX, the
   Macintosh, and Electronic Mail will not survive to the next century.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>   Finally, I'll offer eight opinions that computer scientists  who  venture
   into the real world should consider:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>      1.</sentence><sentence>Slowness Kills.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>      2.</sentence><sentence>Big, integrated systems lose.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>      3.</sentence><sentence>Virtual << Real.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>      4.</sentence><sentence>Programmer productivity is not so important.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>      5.</sentence><sentence>Technology transfer rarely works.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>      6.</sentence><sentence>Engineers don't buy; they log roll.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>      7.</sentence><sentence>Industrial funding is difficult.</sentence></paragraph>
