 Topic:	Exploring the autonomous learning problem with mathematical programming
 When: Tuesday February 12, 1991, 1:30-2:30pm,  Doherty Hall 3313
The autonomous learning problem (ALP) is defined as: A series of training
examples is provided, characterized by a conjunction of specific values of a
set of common attributes, and a class to which it belongs.</sentence><sentence>The goal is to
construct an effective classifier for categorizing these examples.</sentence><sentence>The ALP
is formulated as a set-covering problem, a set-partitioning problem, and as
a general 0-1 problem.</sentence><sentence>This enables an extnesive investigation to be
carried out as to the relationships between rules and examples; "data" and
"knowledge"; and attitudes regarding the "best" set of rules forming a rule
base".</sentence></paragraph>
