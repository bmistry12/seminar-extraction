<paragraph><sentence> TITLE:  Dante II and Beyond: Exploration Robots</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In the summer of 1994, Dante II successfully descended into the crater
of an active Alaskan volcano using a combination of walking and
rappelling locomotion.</sentence><sentence>While linked by satellite to a very remote base
station, Dante relied on a suite of sensors and semi-autonomous
operational modes to traverse the very challenging terrain.</sentence><sentence>Once at
the crater floor, fumarole gas data and detailed video images in
addition to high resolution laser-built terrain reconstructions were
viewed live by scientists in several US locations.</sentence><sentence>During its ascent
out of the crater, Dante tipped over while attempting to climb a steep
side slope of muddy ash and had to be recovered.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Much was learned in this fast-paced, high risk research project in
areas ranging from robot configuration to telepresence control to
field operations and logistics.</sentence><sentence>One measure of the success of the
Dante II research is the degree by which the lessons learned can be
articulated, communicated and applied to future generations of
exploration robots.</sentence></paragraph>
