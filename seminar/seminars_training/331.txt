<paragraph><sentence>Eliminating combinatorics from the match in production systems  (or  rule-based
systems)  is  important  for  various  reasons  like real-time performance, the
utility issue in machine learning, parallel implementations and modeling  human
cognition.</sentence><sentence>The goal of this work is to eliminate match combinatorics without
sacrificing production system functionality.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>  Combinatorics arise in production match due to the ambiguity about which data
items (or working memory elements) can actually match a production's condition.</sentence><sentence>In a production with multiple conditions, a cascading effect of such  ambiguity
may  lead  to  an  exponential  match effort.</sentence><sentence>We have investigated a variety of
approaches to eliminate match combinatorics, and have focused on the  following
two that appear quite promising:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>   - The  unique-attribute  approach:  This approach restricts the working
     memory representation and completely eliminates the ambiguity.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>   - The tokenless-match approach: This approach changes the match process
     so  as to allow some local ambiguity, but avoids the cascading effect
     that leads to combinatorics.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>  I  will  present  detailed  theoretical  and  experimental  analyses  of  the
performance    improvements    possible   with   these   approaches   and   the
representational tradeoffs involved in them.</sentence></paragraph>
