          "BUILDING THE ENTERPRISE THROUGH OBJECT TECHNOLOGY"</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>* Increase Competitiveness
* Increase Maintainability
* Enjoy Flexibility in Application Functionality
* Learn about Advances in Technology
* Gain Productivity through Reuse
* Reduce Costs</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>To gain the competitive advantage in today's rapidly
changing business environment, you need to respond
quickly to the market opportunities.</sentence><sentence>Through object
technology you can provide the flexibility needed for
this market.</sentence><sentence>Objects enable firms to deliver proprietary
software solutions rapidly as well as integrate the
entire operation with a client/server architecture.</sentence><sentence>Hewlett-Packard can offer you a clear path to
object-based computing through products, programs,
consulting, and solutions that are available today.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>LEARN FIRST HAND.</sentence><sentence>Hewlett-Packard will broadcast through NTU (National Technology
University) a special event focusing on object-oriented technology.</sentence><sentence>This telebroadcast will feature key speakers from HP Laboratories as
well as commercial examples of how an object technology is used in
the telecommunications and financial industries.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Here are highlights of what you'll be hearing from some of the
 speakers:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence> Joel S. Birnbaum, Ph.D
 Senior Vice President of Research and Development
 Director, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Dr. Birnbaum's talk will set the stage for the rest of the NTU
broadcast.</sentence><sentence>He will discuss how the first beneficiaries of
object technology will be software developers;  objects help
manage complexity, encourage reuse, and lead to better, more
maintainable code.</sentence><sentence>The promise of object technology is that
software designed to match the way people think will be easier
to use and more useful.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Jeff Eastman, Ph.D.</sentence><sentence>Consulting Engineer, Hewlett-Packard
Software Engineering Systems Division</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Dr. Eastman is the chief architect of HP's Distributed
Smalltalk.</sentence><sentence>His presentation will discuss how distributed
systems are inherently object-oriented;  thus, it is natural to
use object technology in their design and implementation.</sentence><sentence>The
Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker
Architecture (CORBA) is a set of emerging industry standards for
the construction of object-oriented distributed systems and
applications.</sentence><sentence>This talk will assess the state-of-the-art in the
CORBA arena and provide an architectural framework for
discussing distributed computing systems.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Mary E.S.</sentence><sentence>Loomis, Ph.D.
Director, Software Technology Lab
Hewlett-Packard Laboratories</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Dr. Loomis has over 20 years' experience in software engineering
and data management.</sentence><sentence>Her presentation will focus on object
database management systems (ODBMS).</sentence><sentence>Topics include: sources of
object persistence, architectures of ODBMS products, extended
relational and language bound, object model support, distributed
functionality, and standards and technical directions.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Derek Coleman
Manager, Software Reuse Department
Hewlett-Packard Laboratories</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Mr. Coleman is a co-author of "Object-oriented Development:  the
Fusion Method," published by Prentice-Hall.</sentence><sentence>Fusion is an
object-oriented method that was developed to meet the needs of
HP's large and diverse software engineering community.</sentence><sentence>The
presentation will explain the Fusion method and its underlying
rationale.</sentence><sentence>The talk will also present HP's experiences
introducing Fusion into actual use on live projects.</sentence><sentence>His
presentation will conclude with a status report on CASE tools
and current research.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Real world examples:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In addition to these specialized presentations, the telecast
will feature industrial colleagues presenting how their use of
object technology and object-oriented development tools greatly
enhanced their application development process.</sentence></paragraph>
