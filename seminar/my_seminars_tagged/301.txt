( SEE ABSTRACT BELOW ) < /paragraph > < paragraph > CIMDS SEMINAR < /paragraph > WHO : <speaker>Ramesh Bollapragada </speaker>  , Graduate student , GSIA/Robotics Program WHERE : 4623 WEAN HALL WHEN : Friday , Oct 7 at <stime>1pm</stime> TITLE : AN ASYNCHRONOUS TEAM SOLUTION TO SCHEDULING STEEL PLANTS IN DIRECT HOT CHARGE MODE < paragraph > In this talk , I will address the problem of direct hot charge scheduling of steel rolling mills in the primary steel making area ( continous caster and hot strip mill ) . The work involved scheduling a huge order book ( of approximately 5000 orders ) with the objective of minimizing the operating costs , tardiness and inventory . This is a combinatorial problem due to complex constraints built into it . < /paragraph > < paragraph > We proposed an asynchronous team solution for this domain . The intial schedules were generated by two different construction algorithms whose performance on the objective function was different from each other . I will present some preliminary results which show significant improvements in the evaluation costs when the above designs are integrated in the framework of ATeams . < /paragraph > < paragraph > This research was carried out at <speaker>IBM 's </speaker>   <speaker>T.J. Watson </speaker> Research Center over the summer of 1994 . This work was performed jointly with Dr.Sesh Murthy of <speaker>IBM </speaker> . < /paragraph > HOST : Norman Sadeh , CIMDS , Robotics Institute < paragraph > -- < /paragraph > < paragraph > < /paragraph >
