While linked by satellite to a very remote base station , Dante relied on a suite of sensors and semi-autonomous operational modes to traverse the very challenging terrain . Once at the crater floor , fumarole gas data and detailed video images in addition to high resolution laser-built terrain reconstructions were viewed live by scientists in several US locations . During its ascent out of the crater , Dante tipped over while attempting to climb a steep side slope of muddy ash and had to be recovered . < /paragraph > < paragraph > Much was learned in this fast-paced , high risk research project in areas ranging from robot configuration to telepresence control to field operations and logistics . One measure of the success of the Dante II research is the degree by which the lessons learned can be articulated , communicated and applied to future generations of exploration robots . < /paragraph > Host : Yangsheng Xu ( xu+ @ cs.cmu.edu ) Appointment : Ava Cruse ( avac @ cs.cmu.edu )
