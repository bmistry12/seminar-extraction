WHERE : ADAMSON WING Auditorium in <speaker>Baker </speaker> <speaker>Hall SPEAKER </speaker>  : Dr. Kishan Baheti National Science Foundation TITLE : Control and Manufacturing Research and Education Programs at the National Science Foundation < paragraph > Manufacturing is a highly integrative discipline and manufacturing-related problems are among the most complex , interdisciplinary problems faced by modern society . The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) has encouraged university researchers to build linkages with industry for manufacturing research and education , in individual research projects , Engineering Research Centers , Science and Technology Centers , and Engineering Education Coalititions . As a result , industry participation in manufacturing related university proposals and university faculty participation in small business research projects has steadily increased . At the individual investigator level , the GOALI ( Grants Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry ) Program provides for Engineering Faculty Internship and Industry-University Cooperative Research Projects . The presentation will discuss NSF programs to increase cooperation and cross fertilization of ideas between control systems engineering and advanced manufacturing technology . < /paragraph > SPEAKER BIO : < paragraph > Dr. Kishan Baheti is a Program Director for Engineering Systems Program in the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems at NSF . Dr. Baheti received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from <speaker>Oregon </speaker> State University in 1975 . From 1975 to 1989 , he was a research scientist with General Electric Corporate Research and Development Center in Schenectady , New <speaker>York </speaker> . His research interests include sensor based multivariable control systems for advanced manufacturing applications . He has received the IR-100 award for his contributions to the design of vision based robotic welding system . In 1994 , he was given the Distinguished Member Award for his contributions and service to IEEE Control Systems Society . < /paragraph > < paragraph > < /paragraph >
