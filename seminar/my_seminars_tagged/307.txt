Location : <speaker>Baker </speaker> <speaker>Hall </speaker> , Adamson Wing Host : Michael Erdmann , x7883 < paragraph > In the coming decades , man will probably send robots to explore the solar system . In particular , we envision the need for mobile robots that can navigate , map , and acquire samples on another planet , such as <speaker>Mars </speaker> . To perform these tasks in such isolated and uncertain environments , the robots must be highly reliable and fairly autonomous . < /paragraph > < paragraph > The CMU Planetary Rover project has built the Ambler , a highly mobile and energy efficient six-legged walking robot . Integrating the component technologies of planning , perception and real-time control , we have developed a system that autonomously walks the Ambler over rugged terrain . The talk will describe research results in real-time control of many degrees of freedom , perception of rugged terrain using a laser range-finder , and gait , footfall , and leg-recovery planning . The components are integrated using the distributed Task Control Architecture ( TCA ) , which supports concurrent planning , execution , monitoring , and error recovery . The talk will describe our integration efforts and the strategies employed for ensuring reliable and competent performance of the Ambler . < /paragraph > -- -- -- -- -- Refreshments will be served from 3:15-3:30 . Discussion and questions : 4:30-5:00 . Everyone in the CMU community is invited to attend . -- -- -- -- -- < paragraph > < /paragraph >
