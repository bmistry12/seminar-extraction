Papadimitriou </speaker>  Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of  , <speaker>San </speaker> <speaker>Diego </speaker> <stime>7:15</stime> - <etime>8:15PM</etime> pm 4623  <speaker>Wean Hall </speaker> ( via Picturetel from UCSD ) moderated locally by <speaker>Garth Gibson </speaker>  ABSTRACT : We often make decisions on the basis of very restricted information. < paragraph > < sentence > How are we then to measure the quality of such decisions ? < /sentence > < sentence > The economist <speaker>Leonard Savage </speaker>  proposed in the 1950 's that the outcome of such on-line decisions be compared with the optimum outcome , achievable if complete information had been available. < /sentence > < sentence > Recent research by computer scientists in on-line algorithms has shown the wide applicability of this idea. < /sentence > < sentence > I am going to review on-line algorithms for terrain navigation and exploration , compiling for parallel machines , and distributed optimization. < /sentence > < sentence > I shall also discuss how on-line algorithms can help determine the value of information and improve the organization of the decision-making process. < /sentence > < sentence > -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- < /paragraph > < paragraph > This talk is the next in a series of live , interactive video conferences that will be held every Wednesday 7 pm - <etime>8:30PM</etime> pm between  20 and May 5 1993. < /sentence > < sentence > These conferences are being organized by a few west coast schools , hence the name , the West Coast Colloquium. < /sentence > < sentence > This will be something of a multiple university distinguished speakers series. < /sentence > < sentence > The participants , so far , are Berkeley , Stanford , <speaker>Washington </speaker> , UCLA ,  <speaker>UC San </speaker> <speaker>Diego </speaker> ,  <speaker>UC Santa </speaker> <speaker>Barbara </speaker> , and us. < /sentence > < sentence > The technology is Picturetel based with conference bridging by AT & <speaker>T. < </speaker>  /sentence > < sentence > There will be multiple monitors at each site ; cameras at every site are voice activated to force the display to show that site , so that the distributed audience can have camera time to ask questions. < /sentence > < sentence > Wednesday 's seminars are still experiemental. < /sentence > < sentence > Many sites have yet to get all the equipment working for such an ambitious conference call. < /sentence > < sentence > Even if everything is working well , there will be a noticeable lag between your speech and its broadcast to your and others ' monitors. < /sentence > < /paragraph >
