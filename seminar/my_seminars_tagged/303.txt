Algorithms exist for handling a variety of robot shapes , configurations , motion constraints , and environments . Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move ; less attention has been paid to the problem of unknown or partially-known environments . This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map . Existing approaches plan an initial global path based on known information and then modify the plan locally as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors . This strategy works well in environments with small , sparse obstacles , but it can lead to grossly suboptimal and incomplete results in cluttered spaces . An alternative approach is to replan a global path from scratch each time a new obstacle is discovered . This brute-force approach is optimal , but it is grossly inefficient . This talk describes a new algorithm , D* , capable of planning paths in unknown , partially-known , and changing environments in an efficient , optimal , and complete manner . D* models the environment as a graph , where each node represents a robot state , and each arc represents the cost of moving between two states . Initially , a path is planned from the goal to the robot 's location using known information . As the robot moves , its sensors discover obstacles in its path . These discoveries are handled by modifying the arc costs . D* propagates cost changes minimally to compute a new optimal path . The process repeats until the robot reaches the goal or determines that it can not . < /paragraph > < paragraph > D* was implemented and compared head-to-head with the brute force replanner to verify optimality and determine the performance improvement . It was integrated with an obstacle avoidance system and tested on the Navlab II . The robot succeeded in finding a specified goal in a cluttered environment given no initial map information . The algorithm and the results will be presented . < /paragraph > Host : Yangsheng Xu ( xu+ @ cs.cmu.edu ) Appointment : Ava Cruse ( avac @ cs.cmu.edu )
