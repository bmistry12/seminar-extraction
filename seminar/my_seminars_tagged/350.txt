Yuan </speaker>   Zheng - Dept. < /sentence > < sentence > Electrical Engineering  State University The most difficult problem to develop an autonomous biped robot is the programming of the biped walking gaits , especially when the robot needs to negotiate different terrain. < /sentence > < sentence > A Neural Gait Synthesis mechanism is proposed to solve this problem. < /sentence > < sentence > The mechanism is implemented by using a gait synthesizer. < /sentence > < sentence > The gait synthesizer consists of a number of functional units including a Central Pattern Generator , an Adaptive Unit , a Learning Unit and a Knowledge Base. < /sentence > < sentence > The Central Pattern Generator is responsible for generating voluntary motion of the biped ; the Adaptive Unit is used to modify the motion patterns generated by the Central Pattern Generator for negotiating a new terrain ; the function of the Learning Unit is to extract pattern features from newly learned walking gaits ; and the Knowledge Base stores the pattern features along with terrain conditions. < /sentence > < sentence > Most of the recent efforts have been on the Adaptive Unit.Two neural networks have been developed to implement the Adaptive Unit.The first network consists of twenty reciprocally inhibited and excited neurons and is trained by a reinforcement learning rule. < /sentence > < sentence > Two learning algorithms are introduced. < /sentence > < sentence > The primary concern of the first algorithm is the speed of gait modification , whereas the second algorithm provides a solution with minimum energy consumption. < /sentence > < sentence > The second neural network consists of an inverse and a feed forward models , and both are multi-layer perceptrons. < /sentence > < sentence > The network is trained by using a distal learning rule. < /sentence > < sentence > It is shown that the network generates an adequate gait pattern even with no direct teacher involved in the training. < /sentence > < sentence > Finally , simulation and experimental results will be presented. < /sentence > < sentence > HOSTED BY : HAGEN SCHEMPF , x6884 *************************************************************** -- ****************|**************************|************************** * | | * *Tim Meadows | Field Robotics Center | <speaker>Carnegie Mellon </speaker>  Univ. < /sentence > < sentence > * * | | * *412-268-7085 | Fax : 412-682-1793 | tmeadows @ frc.ri.cmu.edu * * | | * ********************************************************************** < /sentence >
