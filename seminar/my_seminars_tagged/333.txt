Berkeley < /paragraph > < paragraph > RISC in a robotics context stands for Reduced Intricacy in Sensing and Control . But it shares the same philosophy as RISC computer design . The idea is to replace complicated manipulation and sensing steps with combinations of simple ones . Industrial robotics research has focussed on anthropomorphism in the hope that once robots become sufficiently human-like , they will be able to solve all the tasks that they are currently incapable of doing . This approach is seductive and has led researchers further and further away from the real problems that hinder the proliferation of robots in manufacturing . The enthusiasm for robotics in industry which reached a peak in the mid 80 's has all but disappeared after a protracted lack of progress on these problems . < /paragraph > As Whitney [ 1 ] and others have argued , even if robots with human-like dexterity and flexibility could be built , and they are clearly decades away , they will be completely impractical economically . The problem is that robots , at least in an industrial setting , need more dexterity and sensing capability than they have today , but far less than a human being . We are trying a RISC approach to achieving this capability . We achieve complicated manipulation and sensing performance by using *just enough* simple elements , namely : < paragraph > * Dextrous manipulation is replaced by two or three transfer/grasping steps with simple , specialized grippers . < /paragraph > < paragraph > * Dense sensor input like vision or tactile or rangefinder data is replaced by very low resolution sensors , like finger gap , optical beam or low-resolution tactile . < /paragraph > < paragraph > This lets us build fast , cheap , simple , robust systems now rather than later . The sensors are small and inexpensive enough that they can be placed throughout the environment , including on every gripper , so that each operation can be monitored throughout a task . < /paragraph > < paragraph > This talk will give an overview of the approach , and some of the new research problems that it suggests . Then we will describe some recent results on beam sensing . In particular , we find that processing beam data provides object recognition times in milliseconds rather than minutes , and much finer localization than is possible with vision . If a sensor provides few accurate values ( rather than an enormous number of inaccurate ones as with vision ) , recognition reduces to a hash table lookup . < /paragraph > < paragraph > [ 1  <speaker>] D.
