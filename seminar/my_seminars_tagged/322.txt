Pai </speaker>  , Department of Computer Science , Cornell University Title : Programming Complex Mechanical Systems with Applications to Dynamic Walking Date : Friday ,  8 , 1991 Time : <stime>3:30</stime> p.m. until <stime>4:30</stime> p.m. < sentence > Location<location>Baker Hall , Adamson Wing</location>  <speaker>Baker </speaker> <speaker>Hall </speaker>    Host : Michael Erdmann , x7883 We consider the problem of developing control programs for complex mechanical systems with multiple , simultaneous tasks. < /sentence > < sentence > Such systems are difficult to program using traditional robot programming methods. < /sentence > < sentence > As a concrete example , we consider the problem of controlling a human-like machine to walk dynamically in three dimensions. < /sentence > < sentence > This problem has several applications , including the design and construction of walking machines capable of rough terrain mobility , computer graphic animation of complex figures , and more distantly , understanding human walking. < /sentence > < sentence > We describe a new framework called `` Least Constraint '' for programming such a machine. < /sentence > < sentence > In this framework , we do not specify the desired motion in terms of trajectories but rather more weakly as a collection of assertions to hold. < /sentence > < sentence > These assertions are expressed as time varying inequality constraints in various domains. < /sentence > < sentence > We thus attempt to capture the essential requirements of a task without imposing unnecessary structure. < /sentence > < sentence > The constraints are solved at run time to produce control torques. < /sentence > < sentence > Constraint satisfaction is performed using a fast iterative technique which takes advantage of functional decomposition and automatic differentiation. < /sentence > < sentence > The approach has been successful in generating stable dynamic walking with various gaits. < /sentence > < sentence > We have implemented an object-oriented programming environment for this purpose in Common Lisp using CLOS , and tested the approach using a full rigid-body mechanics simulation. < /sentence > < sentence > We shall describe the results of our simulation experiments with the aid of computer animation. < /sentence > < sentence > -- -- -- -- -- Refreshments will be served from 3:15-3:30. < /sentence > < sentence > Discussion and questions : 4:30-5:00. < /sentence > < sentence > Everyone in the CMU community is invited to attend. < /sentence > < sentence > -- -- -- -- -- < /sentence >
