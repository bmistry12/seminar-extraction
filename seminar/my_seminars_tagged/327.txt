Knowledge representation issues will be addressed concerning the modelling and semantics of fuzzy rules . Some limitations of the fuzzy logic control algorithm will be pointed out in the scope of knowledge-based systems . In a second part , an introduction to possibilistic logic will be provided . Possibilistic logic is a logic of incomplete evidence that tries to reconcile fuzzy sets and classical logic . It also belongs to the current stream of research pertaining to non-monotonic reasoning and belief revision . < /paragraph > Didier Dubois receives his PhD degree in 1977 . He was a Visiting Scholar at the School of Electrical Engineering at Purdue University in 1978 . From 1980 until 1983 , he worked as a Research Engineer at Center for Studies and Research in Toulouse , in the production research area . He is presently a CNRS Researcher at the University of Toulouse . His main topics of interest are the modeling of imprecision and uncertainty , the representation of knowledge and approximate reasoning for expert system , operations research , and decision analysis . He is the author or coauthor of numerous publications , especially in the field of fuzzy sets and their applications to operations research and artificial intelligence . He coauthored ( with <speaker>H. Prade </speaker>  ) two books on fuzzy sets and possibility theory and has coedited a volume on nonstandard logics and several special issues of scientific journals . Since 1979 he has also been coediting BUSEFAL , a bulletin on fuzzy sets and related topics . He is on the editorial board of the journals : Fuzzy Sets and Systems , International Journal of Approximate reasoning , Revue d'Intelligence Artificielle ; and more recently : the International Journal of General Systems and the ORSA Journal on Computing . Dubois is a member of the Council of the International Fuzzy Systems Association . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Hosts : <speaker>Mark Fox/Jeanluc </speaker>  Koning Appointments : Jeanluc.Koning @ ri , x7598
