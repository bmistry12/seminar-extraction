Chippewa Falls , WI 54729 Multistage interconnection networks ( MINs ) form the backbone of traditional vector supercomputers. < paragraph > < sentence > First , an historical perspective of MINs in vector supercomputers is given. < /sentence > < sentence > This is followed by the description of an on-going study of large-scale vector-oriented MINs. < /sentence > < sentence > An accurate simulation model is described. < /sentence > < sentence > Performance results are then presented ; these results are focused on determining the relative impor- tance of several MIN characteristics. < /sentence > < sentence > -- -- - <speaker>Jim </speaker> <speaker>Smith </speaker> was formerly with the University of  where<location>developed the</location>  developed  concept of the `` Decoupled Access/Execute Architectures '' . < /sentence > < sentence > He then went on to build such a machine , the ZS-1 , for the Astronautics Corp. of America. < /sentence > < sentence > After Seymour Cray left to form Cray Computer , he joined Cray Research as computer architect. < /sentence > < sentence > The abstract may sound a little dry , but I think the talk will not disappoint you , especially if you wonder what is happening in this part of the supercomputer world [ I do n't want to say more ; Cray Research after all is the company that developed the Cray X-MP and the Cray Y-MP . ] < /sentence > < sentence > -- TRG < /paragraph > < paragraph > 9 < /sentence > < /paragraph >
