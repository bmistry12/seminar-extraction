Flynn </speaker>  MIT AI Lab < /paragraph > < paragraph > Utilizing the large piezoelectric coefficients and high dielectric constants of ferroelectric thin films , it is possible to microfabricate ultrasonic motors on silicon substrates . This talk will describe our efforts in this area . By using ferroelectric thin films of lead zirconate titanate ( PZT ) , a two-order of magnitude improvement over bulk ceramic materials is obtained in breakdown strength . This characteristic , in combination with high dielectric permittivities , leads to a three-order of magnitude improvement over electrostatic micromotors in terms of energy densities . < /paragraph > < paragraph > We have fabricated resonant structures on one micron thick silicon nitride membranes which are able to spin two-millimeter diameter rotors which are placed down on top . Stator-rotor interaction is achieved through frictional coupling and an inherent geardown creates motors which run at low speeds with high torques . < /paragraph > < paragraph > I will also discuss experiments with 8 mm diameter ultrasonic motors fabricated from bulk ceramic PZT and an analysis of the contact mechanics at the rotor-stator interface where the overall efficiency of the motor is critically determined . Models of line contact , Hertzian contact and linear spring contact for Coulomb and viscous friction have been derived and simulations will be presented which predict speed-torque curves , efficiencies and overall output power for various conditions of operating voltage and normal force . < /paragraph > < paragraph > Work in progress on a new laser-etching technique for piezoelectric ultrasonic micromotors offers promise for simplifying the fabrication steps and developing more practical motors . We plan to incorporate these actuators into small robots and create truly integrated intelligent machines . Presently , we are developing small palm-sized autonomous robots , using conventional electromagnetic motors , with onboard computers and 18 sensors which can crawl through tubes , pick up small objects and cooperate on tasks . Later , ultrasonic motors will be retrofit as they become available , enabling miniaturization . I will show videotapes of these machines in a robotic ant colony and as intestine crawlers for telepresence surgery . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- < /paragraph >
