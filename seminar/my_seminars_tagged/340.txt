'' While there has been some productive cross- fertilization , there are many further possibilities for useful interactions . This talk will outline some areas of image understanding where photogrammetric techniques could be useful , such as multiple image solutions and stochastic modeling , and similarly , some topics in photogrammetry where image understanding concepts could be applied . The eventual goal should be the tighter integration of both fields , looking beyond automating individual operator 's tasks and emulating paper maps to new ways of obtaining , processing , and exploiting image information . As an example of the integration of image understanding and photogrammetry , the use of snakes for automated image-map registration will be discussed . < /paragraph > Host : Dave McKeown , dmm @ cs.cmu.edu
