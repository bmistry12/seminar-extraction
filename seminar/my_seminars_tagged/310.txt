WHERE : ADAMSON WING Auditorium in <speaker>Baker </speaker> <speaker>Hall SPEAKER </speaker>  : <speaker>Mel Siegel </speaker>  Senior Research Scientist Robotics Institute TITLE : 3D-TV ( and Workstations ) High definition , high speed displays integrated with fast digitization , image storage , and image processing now permit us to implement several concepts for 3D-sterescopic television ( and computer workstations ) , many of which have been around , unimplementable , for a long time . In this talk I will : < paragraph > -- review the fundamentals of binocular 3D-stereoscopic vision < /paragraph > < paragraph > -- review historical approaches to 3D-image and 3D-stream pair display < /paragraph > < paragraph > -- narrow the discussion to approaches that use a single more-or-less flat screen ( like a TV or workstation monitor ) < /paragraph > -- describe my group 's research in several areas : < paragraph > ** the physics of re-creating naked-eye and augmented-eye reality < /paragraph > ** the state-of-the-art in video : delivering the full spatial and temporal resolution of an NTSC stream per eye < paragraph > ** three increasingly sophisticated approaches to presenting video and/or computer graphics on a workstation < /paragraph > < paragraph > ~~ a well known special purpose hardware based full-screen , half spatial resolution approach < /paragraph > < paragraph > ~~ our adaptation of this approach to an X-Windows environment , still full screen < /paragraph > < paragraph > ~~ our new `` Stereo-in-Windows '' approach , which allows arbitrary mixes of stereo and flat XWindows on one screen at one time at full resolution < /paragraph > ** progress in the ( I will show you : related ) areas of image compression , intermediate view interpolation , and user-adjustable stereopsis < paragraph > -- demonstrate as much of this as it is practical to set up in the Adamson Wing auditorium [ TBD ] . < /paragraph >
