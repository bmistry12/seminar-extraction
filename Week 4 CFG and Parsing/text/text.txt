John Smith enjoyed going to the movies
He watches western movies
Jane Lee sometimes went to the cinema with John
She didn't like western movies
They watch horror movies
Every child likes Kim
Kim likes this child
The man used the telescope
The man used the telescope in December
The man used the telescopes with Mary
John walked home with Mary
